    "Desarrollar un modelo efectivo de machine learning requiere entrenar, evaluar y seleccionar cuidadosamente el modelo con mejor rendimiento. El entrenamiento permite que el modelo aprenda patrones a partir de los datos, la evaluación asegura que generalice bien a datos nuevos, y la selección identifica la solución más confiable y robusta. Juntos, estos pasos garantizan que el modelo final ofrezca resultados precisos y consistentes, abordando el problema de manera efectiva y maximizando su aplicabilidad en el mundo real.\n",

    "* Entrenar: Es donde el modelo aprende patrones de los datos. Esto le permite hacer predicciones precisas y generalizar a nuevos datos.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluar: Comprobamos si el modelo funciona bien con datos nuevos usando métricas adaptadas. Esto evita que el modelo sea poco confiable.\n",

    "**Justificación del subconjunto de datos:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizar un subconjunto de 10,000 registros es una estrategia eficiente para realizar pruebas iniciales y ajustes de hiperparámetros de manera más rápida y efectiva. Este enfoque permite obtener una visión general del rendimiento de cada modelo sin consumir excesivos recursos computacionales o tiempo. Una vez que se identifiquen los modelos más prometedores, estos se pueden entrenar y evaluar nuevamente utilizando el conjunto de datos completo, logrando así una evaluación más precisa y robusta. Esta estrategia asegura que solo los modelos mejor ajustados y con mayor potencial sean sometidos a un entrenamiento a gran escala, optimizando el proceso de selección y evaluación de modelos.\n",

    "**Validación cruzada y machine learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "La validación cruzada es un componente esencial en la construcción de modelos de machine learning, ya que garantiza que los modelos se generalicen bien a datos no vistos y ayuda a prevenir el sobreajuste. Al emplear técnicas como la validación cruzada y el cálculo de múltiples métricas, se asegura una evaluación completa y equitativa del rendimiento de cada modelo. Esto permite una toma de decisiones informada y basada en datos sólidos."

    "  \n",
    "Basándose en los análisis previos y las métricas observadas, LightGBM se destaca como una elección sólida. Presenta una precisión y recall bastante altos, lo que demuestra su eficacia para detectar clientes con riesgo de retraso. Además, su FPR es moderado, sugiriendo un buen balance entre precisión y reducción de falsos positivos. LightGBM es conocido por su eficiencia en el manejo de grandes conjuntos de datos, lo que lo convierte en una opción confiable.\n",

    "\n",
    "En el análisis del conjunto de datos, especialmente al predecir eventos críticos como el incumplimiento de préstamos y retrasos de pago, se ha decidido enfocar en ciertas métricas clave para evaluar el rendimiento de los modelos. A continuación, se explica por qué el recall, la precisión, el F1 score y la tasa de falsos positivos (FPR) son las métricas más importantes en esta elección.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall**\n",
    "El recall es fundamental porque mide la capacidad del modelo para identificar correctamente los préstamos que tendrán retraso en el pago. Un alto recall es crucial para minimizar el riesgo financiero, ya que no detectar un retraso puede resultar en pérdidas significativas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precisión**\n",
    "La precisión indica cuántas de las predicciones de retraso en el pago del modelo son realmente correctas. Una alta precisión es esencial para evitar falsos positivos, que pueden llevar a decisiones erróneas como rechazar préstamos a clientes solventes, afectando la satisfacción del cliente y la eficiencia operativa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1 Score**\n",
    "El F1 score proporciona un equilibrio entre precisión y recall. Es especialmente útil en datasets desbalanceados, como en problemas de retraso en el pago de préstamos. Un alto F1 score asegura que el modelo sea robusto y confiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasa de Falsos Positivos (FPR)**\n",
    "La FPR mide la proporción de instancias negativas clasificadas incorrectamente como positivas. En el contexto bancario, un alto FPR puede significar que muchos clientes solventes son clasificados incorrectamente como riesgosos, afectando la relación con los clientes y la rentabilidad del banco.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cabe mencionar que, es crucial enfocarse en el recall, la precisión, el F1 score y la tasa de falsos positivos (FPR). Estas métricas proporcionan una evaluación completa y equilibrada del rendimiento del modelo, asegurando que se identifiquen correctamente los casos de retraso en el pago y se minimicen los errores de clasificación. Elegir las métricas adecuadas garantiza que el modelo sea efectivo y confiable en la toma de decisiones críticas para el negocio bancario."
